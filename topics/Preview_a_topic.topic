    <procedure title="Open a preview">
        <step>In the %product% tool window, open the topic file in the editor.</step>
        <step><include from="lib.topic" element-id="open-preview"/>.</step>
        <step>The preview area will appear to the right and also it will stay as a tab so it is always on hand.</step>
        <p>The preview updates automatically as you type.</p>
    </procedure>
    <p>You can do the following in the preview mode:</p>
    <list>
        <li>Change the preview area size using the icon. Pull in left to see the in-page toc.</li>
        <li>Open the preview in a browser to check how the topic will look in the web.
        Switch between light-dark mode and between topics to check. </li>
        <li>Copy the preview link to share with the users in the same local network.</li>
    </list>
    <tip>The local video files preview works only for certain codecs,
        however they still will be built and correctly displayed in the web help instance.
        In preview we will display a stub.</tip>

    <p>The preview will be updated depending on the selected IDE theme,
        for example, for <control>Darcula</control> theme it will be dark, for <control>IntelliJ Light</control> â€” light.</p>
